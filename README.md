### Take-Home Exercise
#
The Lightning team at Unity is looking for a better understanding of how Creators use their products and features and have come to you for help. Your task is to help the team validate or refine their questions of interest, explore relevant datasets at our disposal, ask clarifying questions as you progress, and report the main findings and insights back to them at the end. Your primary contacts for the task at hand are 1) the Product Manager of Lightning, and 2) the Engineering Manager of Lightning. Both have related, but different questions that are listed below.

_Background:_
_What is Light Baking in the context of Unity?_

- [How to build Lightmaps in Unity 2020.1 | Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJ4fl-KBDR8)
- Unity Editor documentation: [Light Mode: Baked](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/LightMode-Baked.html)
#

**Questions** (Product Manager)

- How is our product doing?
- How many creators do we have?
- How much time do creators in general use our product/features?
- Are the creators happy with the product/features?
- Who are our creators?
- Are our product/features helping the creators in a better way?
#

**Questions** (Engineering Manager)

- Did the creators see any errors when creating with our product/features?
- How many creators are using “bakeBackend”?
- Which “bakeBackend” is being used?
- How many used the menu to find lightning tools?
- How many used compute baked within each “bakeBackend”?
- What is the most used size of our light map size?

### How would you present the outcome to the team?

You are going to present the outcome to the team that owns the product. This will be the Unity product manager and internal developers working on the product.

Expected outcome would be easy to read highlights and detailed views both in graph, number, table, and context.

For this task the tools used would be SQL and/or Python and the code used should be included together with the report. If Python is used then information about the packages should be included as well.
