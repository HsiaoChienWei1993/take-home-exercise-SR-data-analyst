## Problem Description

The Lightning team at Unity is looking for a better understanding of how Creators use their products and features and have come to you for help. Your task is to help the team validate or refine their questions of interest, explore relevant datasets at our disposal, ask clarifying questions as you progress, and report the main findings and insights back to them at the end. Your primary contacts for the task at hand are 1) the Product Manager of Lightning, and 2) the Engineering Manager of Lightning. Both have related, but different questions that are listed below.

_Background:_
_What is Light Baking in the context of Unity?_

- [How to build Lightmaps in Unity 2020.1 | Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJ4fl-KBDR8)
- Unity Editor documentation: [Light Mode: Baked](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/LightMode-Baked.html)
#

**Questions** (Product Manager, aka PM)

- How many Creators are using our Lightning tools?
- What user insights do we have on them?
- How much time do they generally spend on our Lightning tools?
- Are they satisfied with our current product/features?

**Questions** (Engineering Manager, aka EM)

- Do Creators experience any errors when using our Lightning tools?
- How many Creators are using “bakeBackend”?
- Which version of “bakeBackend” is used the most?
- How many Creators used the menu button in the Unity Editor to find our Lightning tools?
- What is the preferred size of our light map for Creators?

## Assignment

**Step 1:** Explore and decribe the information contained in the datasets in words, including any limitations you wish to highlight.
**Step 2:** Visualise and describe your main findings to the PM.
**Step 3:** Visualise and describe your main findings to the EM.
