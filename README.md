## Problem Description

The Lightning team at Unity is looking for a better understanding of how Creators use their products and features and have come to you for help. Your task is to help the team validate or refine their questions of interest, explore relevant datasets at our disposal, ask clarifying questions as you progress, and report the main findings and insights back to them at the end. Your primary contacts for the task at hand are 1) the Product Manager of Lightning, and 2) the Engineering Manager of Lightning. Both have related, but different questions that are listed below.

_Background:_
_What is Light Baking in the context of Unity?_

- [How to build Lightmaps in Unity 2020.1 | Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJ4fl-KBDR8)
- Unity Editor documentation: [Light Mode: Baked](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/LightMode-Baked.html)

**Questions** (sent to you via Slack by the Product Manager, aka the PM)

- How many Creators are using our Lightning tools?
- What user insights do we have on them?
- How much time do they generally spend on our Lightning tools?
- Are they satisfied with our current Lightning tools?

**Questions** (sent to you via Slack by the Engineering Manager, aka the EM)

- Do Creators experience any errors when using our Lightning tools?
- How many Creators use “bakeBackend”?
- Which version of “bakeBackend” is used the most?
- How many Creators use the Menu button in the Unity Editor to find our Lightning tools?
- What is the preferred Lightmap size?

## Assignment

**Step 1:**\
Explore and decribe the information contained in the datasets found in the **data** folder in words (!), including any limitations you wish to highlight. Useful information can be found under **documentation**.\
**Step 2:**\
Visualise and describe your main findings to the PM.\
**Step 3:**\
Visualise and describe your main findings to the EM.

## Format

Create a local copy of this repository on your laptop and link a personal private Github repository to it, adding view access for emil.jorgensen@unity3d.com and niels@unity3d.com. You are expected to answer the assignment using one or several Jupyter Notebooks with a suitable combination of headlines, text, code, tables and graphs. Notebooks (.ipynb) should be stored in a dedicated **notebooks** folder, and any executive findings you wish to highlight can be pasted into a slideshow (.gslides, .pptx) in the current **executive slides** folder. Lengthy SQL statements (if used) can optionally be placed in the dedicated folder for that.

*Expected Tooling: Git, GitHub, Python, and SQL*
